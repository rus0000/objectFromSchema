objectFromSchema
================

Traverses JSON schema tree and creates empty Javascript object with only required properties.
Doesn't support schema references and dependencies. Requires lodash.

Node module. To install just copy to your project.

Reading

Use case
--------
JSON schema validation can be used during AJAX communication on a server to sanitize incoming JSON data.

Having wrong request object structure can easily crash your server. To prevent this you need to check every property in the request object if it is present and of valid type.

For JSON schema validation I'm using https://github.com/geraintluff/tv4.

For schema creation http://www.jsonschema.net, but it is not perfect. Better to create schema manually.

In case when request doesnâ€™t pass validation you may need to create empty but valid request object, initialize it and continue to process the request. This is what this module for.

Usage
-----
```
var fs = require('fs'),
    objectFromSchema = require('./objectFromSchema.js'),
    ajaxSchema = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync('./ajax_schema.json')),
    ajaxRequestEmpty = objectFromSchema.objectFromSchema(ajaxSchema);

```
